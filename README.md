# The CosmWasm Security Dojo

*Welcome to :japanese_castle:**Oak's CosmWasm Security Dojo**:japanese_castle:, where all apprentices are welcomed. It doesn't matter which background you came from or how skilled you are or where are you from, the only thing that matters in this Security Dojo is :cyclone: your will to solve challenges and learn :cyclone:*

## First time here?

The challenges that we will be publishing here target a **beginner audience** and could be categorized between easy and medium difficulty. It is the perfect place to start honing your security skills if you are looking to develop **secure CosmWasm smart contracts** or, if you are into security but new to this awesome tech, to **spot common pitfalls** on CW contracts.

To successfully face the challenges you should get familiar with Rust and CosmWasm smart contracts first. There are plenty of resources out there, but the below could be a good starting point:

- [Rust by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html)
- [The CosmWasm Book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/)
- [CosmWasm Academy](https://cosmwasm.getlearnworlds.com/)

## Challenges and topics

For now please consider this repo as :construction: work in progress :construction:, as we will be adding new challenges until we have covered a set of common security bugs that we consider "a must know".

Each challenge will include the working proof of concept along with other functional tests! You can find it under `tests/exploit.rs` but we encourage you to try to craft it yourself first. The experience gained from trying to find the bug and crafting the PoC on your own will make a big difference in your learning journey.

The current set of challenges is listed below:
