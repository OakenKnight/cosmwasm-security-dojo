# Exploit Explanation

In this document, we'll walk you through the security vulnerability that can be exploited in this CosmWasm smart contract.

Before reading further, we encourage you to try finding the vulnerability in the code itself. Come back here once you have found the issue or want to see the solution.

The contract allows users to deposit, borrow, and repay funds. However, it contains a bug that allows users to repeatedly borrow funds. The reason is that a user's debt is not updated in the contract's storage. Don't worry if you're new to this, we'll guide you step by step through the issue.

## A Quick Look at the Issue

The issue lies in the `try_borrow` function of the contract. This function calculates the amount a user can borrow and sends the funds to the user. But it misses a crucial step: updating the user's borrow amount in the contract's storage.

```rust
pub fn try_borrow(
    deps: DepsMut,
    info: MessageInfo,
    amount: Uint128,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // ... (omitted for brevity)

    // send funds to user
    let msg = CosmosMsg::Bank(BankMsg::Send {
        to_address: info.sender.to_string(),
        amount: vec![Coin {
            denom: DENOM.to_string(),
            amount,
        }],
    });

    // update user borrow amount
    borrowed_amount += amount;

    Ok(Response::new()
        .add_message(msg)
        .add_attribute("method", "borrow")
        .add_attribute("amount", amount))
}
```

## How to Fix the Issue

Fear not! Fixing the issue is quite simple. You need to update the user's borrow amount in the contract's storage. Here's the improved `try_borrow` function with the fix applied:

```rust
pub fn try_borrow(
    deps: DepsMut,
    info: MessageInfo,
    amount: Uint128,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // ... (omitted for brevity)

    // send funds to user
    let msg = CosmosMsg::Bank(BankMsg::Send {
        to_address: info.sender.to_string(),
        amount: vec![Coin {
            denom: DENOM.to_string(),
            amount,
        }],
    });

    // update user borrow amount
    borrowed_amount += amount;

    // Save the updated borrow amount to storage
    USER_BORROW.save(deps.storage, &info.sender.to_string(), &borrowed_amount)?;

    Ok(Response::new()
        .add_message(msg)
        .add_attribute("method", "borrow")
        .add_attribute("amount", amount))
}
```

By adding the line `USER_BORROW.save(deps.storage, &info.sender, &borrowed_amount)?;`, we ensure that the user's borrow amount is properly updated in the contract's storage. This prevents the user from repeatedly borrowing funds.

Now you've learned about this simple vulnerability and know how to fix it! Keep exploring, and don't hesitate to dive deeper into CosmWasm smart contract security. The more you learn, the more you'll be prepared to develop secure smart contracts and spot common pitfalls. Happy learning! ðŸš€
